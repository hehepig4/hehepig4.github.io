## Abstract

Building upon our previous work on opponent-aware pricing for hub mobility services, this paper develops a sophisticated deep reinforcement learning model with a novel "multi-policy fusion mechanism". This approach enables more adaptive and profitable pricing strategies in dynamic competitive environments.

## Key Contributions

- Proposed DRLPG (Deep Reinforcement Learning Pricing with multi-policy fusion mechanism), a novel RL-based pricing framework
- Developed a multi-policy fusion mechanism that adaptively combines different pricing strategies based on market conditions
- Demonstrated superior performance in dynamic competitive scenarios through comprehensive experiments
- Achieved higher profitability and better adaptation to opponent strategies compared to existing methods
