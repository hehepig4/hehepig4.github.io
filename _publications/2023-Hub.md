## Abstract

This paper focuses on a new scenario of hub-oriented mobility service, proposing a novel pricing framework that is aware of competitor behaviors. The framework demonstrates remarkable performance in improving platform revenue and operational efficiency.

## Key Contributions

- Introduced the first opponent-aware pricing model for hub-oriented mobility services
- Developed a comprehensive framework that considers competitive dynamics in pricing decisions
- Demonstrated significant improvements in platform revenue and service efficiency through extensive experiments
