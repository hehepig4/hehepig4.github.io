## Abstract

This paper addresses the challenge of log anomaly detection on resource-constrained edge devices. We design **MaidLog**, a novel framework based on large language models that achieves industry-leading zero-shot accuracy while maintaining efficiency suitable for deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources.

## Key Contributions

- Designed MaidLog, an innovative LLM-based framework for zero-shot log anomaly detection
- Achieved industry-leading accuracy without requiring labeled training data
- Optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices
- Demonstrated superior performance across multiple real-world datasets
- Provided a practical solution for automated log analysis in edge computing scenarios
