## Research Topics

My research spans several interconnected areas:

1. **Large Language Models for Data Engineering**: Developing LLM-based systems for automating data engineering tasks, including log analysis and anomaly detection.

2. **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Applying RL techniques to dynamic optimization problems, particularly in pricing strategies and competitive scenarios.

3. **Intelligent Data Systems**: Building end-to-end intelligent systems that bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
