## Abstract

This paper proposes VPLight, a novel reinforcement learning approach for traffic signal control that explicitly incorporates pedestrian dynamics. By considering the interactions between vehicles and pedestrians at intersections, VPLight achieves more effective and safe traffic signal control policies.

## Key Contributions

- Proposed VPLight, a reinforcement learning framework for traffic signal control with pedestrian dynamics
- Developed a comprehensive state representation that captures both vehicle and pedestrian information
- Demonstrated superior performance in balancing vehicle and pedestrian effectiveness
- Validated effectiveness through extensive experiments on real-world traffic scenarios
